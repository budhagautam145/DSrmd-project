## NYPD Shooting Overview

This report investigates New York City shooting incidents from 2006 through 2024. The dataset captures each shootingâ€™s date, time, borough, location classification, and demographic details for both victims and suspects.  

My goal is to develop a logistic regression model that estimates the probability that a given shooting resulted in a homicide, using features such as the borough in which the shooting occurred and the month it occurred. 

Key tools in this analysis:
- **tidyverse** for data cleaning, transformation, and plotting  
- **caret** for partitioning the data and computing the confusion matrix

# Conclusion

The logistic regression model achieved an overall accuracy of **79.9%**.

- **Sensitivity (non-homicide detection)**: 100%  
- **Specificity (homicide detection)**:   0%  

This happens because only about 20% of incidents are flagged as homicides, so predicting the majority class yields ~80% accuracy.  

**Key takeaways & biases**  
- **Class imbalance**: Homicides (~20%) vs. non-homicides (~80%) skews the model.  
- **Limited features**: Borough + victim demographics alone lack predictive power.  
- **Reporting bias**: NYPD logging practices may under- or over-represent certain shootings.
